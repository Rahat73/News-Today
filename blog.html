        <h1 class="font font-bold text-2xl my-3">2. What are the differences between arrow function & regular function?
        </h1>
        <ul class="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto mb-7">
            <li>Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this.</li>
            <li>Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions.</li>
            <li>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’.
                Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword. However, the
                arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying
                to construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new keyword.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="font font-bold text-2xl my-3 ">3. Why do we use template string?</h1>
        <div class="mb-10">
            <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate
                variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of
                JavaScript.
                It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that
                comes
                with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the
                string
                as parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.</p>
            <p>We insert a variable or expression by adding a dollar sign $ and curly braces {} into the string
                `${variable}`. This is much better than the alternative in old JavaScript</p>
            <p>Another great feature of template strings is that we can have strings with multiple lines for better code
                readability. This cannot be done in an easy way with the old style of strings. With the old style of
                strings, we had to concatenate each line of the string to put long strings in multiple lines</p>
